# Without ESL

On April 18, 2021 twelve of Europe's most famous football clubs issued a statement which shocked the world. They announced that they would be leaving the UEFA competition structure and forming their own exclusive league with no possibilities of relegation. Among those twelve teams were six from the English Premier League - Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Liverpool. Immediately fans began to clamor for punishment for these clubs. Among the suggestions were relegation/removal from the Premier League itself.

This app shows what the last ten years of Premier league football would have looked like without those six teams. If you're a fan of one of these clubs, or are just curious, you can put any number of them back into the mix and see how each season would have shaken out.
